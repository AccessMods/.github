# Welcome to the Accessibility Modding Hub

## 🎮 Our Mission
We are a community-driven initiative dedicated to collecting, organizing, and maintaining accessibility mods for mainstream video games. Our goal is to bridge the gap between visually impaired gamers and the titles they want to play by consolidating development efforts under one roof.

## 🚀 How It Works
We believe in open collaboration and stability. Our unique workflow allows developers to maintain ownership of their work while giving players a centralized, trusted source for mods.

1.  **Development:** Mods start in individual developers' repositories.
2.  **Stabilization:** Once a mod is tested and confirmed stable by the community, it moves here.
3.  **Consolidation:** The repository is transferred to this Organization, ensuring long-term maintenance and a central download location for players.

**For Players:** 
Check the **Repositories** tab to find supported games. Look for the "Releases" section on the right side of any repository to download the latest mod installer.

## 🛠️ For Developers
We are always looking for collaborators!

*   **Existing Mods:** If you have a stable mod you'd like to add to the hub, please contact an admin or join our Discord. You will retain full admin rights to your repository.
*   **Tech Stack:** We frequently utilize libraries such as **Tolk**, **Universal Speech**, and engine-specific hooks (Unity, Unreal, etc.).

### Contribution Guidelines
*   **Main Branch = Stable:** We ask that the `main` branch always remains in a playable state.
*   **Pull Requests:** Please use the "Fork and Pull" workflow for major changes to ensure stability.

## 🤝 Join the Community
Discussion, support, and development chat happen on our Discord server.
